Built-in Handlers

1. NotFoundHandler - returns a status 404 not found response back to the requester.
syntax:
  func NotFoundHandler() Handler

2. RedirectHandler - It takes the request that came in and redirect it to another URL.
syntax:
  func RedirectHandler(url string, code int) handler
  it takes 2 parameters. The url to redirect to and status code of that redirect(could be permanent or tempo)

3. StripPrefix - Looks like a middleware
syntax:
  func StripPrefix(prefix string, h handler) handler
  Takes a prefix that's going to remove from the incoming request url. Second is the handler that receives a request after stripPrefix is done. StripPrefix will decorate another handler so you can specify the url with prefix on it and use it with a handler that wasn't expecting the prefix to be there

4. TimeoutHandler
syntax:
  func TimeOutHandler(h Handler, dt time.Duration, msg string) handler
  the first argument is the handler it's decorating. Second is the amount of time taken to process and timeout if request takes too long. If it takes too long it returns a message saying it took to long to respond.

5. FileServer
 syntax:
  func FileServer(root FileSystem) Handler

  filesytem is an interface that defines a method Open that takes the name of a file and returns a File object and an error
